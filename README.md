## Project Overview
In the ever-competitive world of hospitality, staying ahead of the curve requires more than just great service—it demands data-backed strategies. AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain with 20+ years of legacy, found itself facing a tough situation. Competitors were gaining ground, and ineffective decision-making was eating into their market share and revenue.

As a data analyst, I was tasked with helping AtliQ Grands understand their business from a new perspective—through their data!
### Tools Used:
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel
### Power BI Integration:
I leveraged Power BI as the primary tool for visualizing and analyzing data in this project. Power BI enabled me to create an intuitive and interactive dashboard, integrating multiple data sources seamlessly. With its robust features, I implemented advanced DAX measures, built calculated columns, and utilized a variety of visuals, including line charts, donut charts, and KPI cards. The tool’s flexibility allowed for the easy creation of filters, slicers, and tooltips, enhancing the user experience and making insights accessible and actionable for decision-makers.
### Key Takeaways:
- In the hospitality industry, the right data insights can unlock doors to new growth.
- A great dashboard isn’t just about numbers—it’s about clarity, actionability, and foresight.
- Never underestimate the power of going beyond the brief—there’s always more value to uncover!
